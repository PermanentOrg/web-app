# web-app

This is the source code for Permanent.org's front-end.

## Developing

To get started, first create the file for the environment variables.

```
cp .env.template .env
```

Add your environment secrets to `.env`.

Install the project dependencies with `npm install`.

Then run the app using `npm run dev` to point the dev server against your `local.permanent.org` VM accessible at `https://ng.permanent.org:4200`
- Note: You'll need to add a host file redirect to point ng.permanent.org to either localhost or 127.0.0.1

If your development environment is missing the appropriate SSL certificates at `/etc/ssl`, you'll have to configure your browser and OS to trust the auto-generated SSL certificates. See [here](https://github.com/PermanentOrg/devenv/#readme) for more details about getting a local development environment set up.

## Adding new secrets

If adding any new secrets, update `.env.template` and `src/required-secrets.js` with the new variable names.

## Adding new components

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Tests

```
npm install
npm run test
```
