# web-app

This is the source code for Permanent.org's front-end.

## Developing

To get started, first create the file for the environment variables.

```sh
cp .env.template .env
```

Add your environment secrets to `.env`.

You need access to FontAwesome Pro packages to install dependencies.

1. Add your FontAwesome token to `.env`:

```env
FONTAWESOME_PACKAGE_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Then run the app using `npm run dev` to point the dev server against your `local.permanent.org` VM accessible at `https://ng.permanent.org:4200`

- Note: You'll need to add a host file redirect to point ng.permanent.org to either localhost or 127.0.0.1

If your development environment is missing the appropriate SSL certificates at `/etc/ssl`, you'll have to configure your browser and OS to trust the auto-generated SSL certificates. See [here](https://github.com/PermanentOrg/devenv/#readme) for more details about getting a local development environment set up.

## Building

To build the app for production you can run `npm run build`. For building a version of the app to be used in the Permanent devenv, run `npm run build:local`

## Adding new secrets

If adding any new secrets, update `.env.template` and `src/required-secrets.js` with the new variable names.

## Adding new components

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Tests

```
npm install
npm run test
```

Depending on your system configuration, the test runner (Karma) may start a web server and make you manually navigate to a URL to run tests in your actual browser. To run tests directly in the terminal, you may need to pass in a `CHROME_BIN` environment variable to point to your installation of Google Chrome.

```
CHROME_BIN=chromium npm run test
```

The exact value of `CHROME_BIN` may depend on your specific system.

## Storybook

This project uses [Storybook.](https://storybook.js.org/) Run `npm run storybook` to start Storybook locally. Run `npm run build-storybook` to build a copy of Storybook for deployment elsewhere.

## History

This project was initially generated by [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.
